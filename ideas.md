  <core_principles>
    1. **Authenticity**: Replicate the tactile feel of a high-end physical baccarat table (felt textures, card sounds).
    2. **Elegance**: Use gold accents, serif typography, and deep, rich colors to convey luxury.
    3. **Clarity**: Despite the rich visuals, game state and betting options must be instantly readable.
    4. **Ritual**: Emphasize the "squeeze" and the drama of the reveal.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Deep Emerald Green (#0A3D25) as the primary felt color, representing tradition and money.
    Gold (#D4AF37) for borders, winning highlights, and premium UI elements.
    Crimson Red (#800000) for Banker and Player distinct elements.
    The goal is to make the user feel like a VIP in a private room in Macau or Monaco.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Skeuomorphic Table Layout**: The screen mimics a physical table.
    - Top: Dealer/Shoe area (abstracted).
    - Center: Betting areas (Player, Banker, Tie) laid out on the "felt".
    - Bottom: Player controls (Chips, Deal button) on a wooden or leather rail texture.
    - Sides: Roadmaps (Scoreboards) sliding in or fixed as paper-like overlays.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    - **Realistic Chip Stacks**: 3D-rendered chips that stack physically.
    - **Velvet/Felt Texture**: Subtle noise and fabric patterns on the background.
    - **Golden Serif Typography**: Using fonts like 'Playfair Display' or 'Cinzel' for headings.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Tactile & Weighty**: Chips should feel heavy when placed. Cards should slide with momentum. Buttons should have a mechanical "click" feel.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Card Dealing**: Smooth, arc-based trajectories with ease-out.
    - **The Squeeze**: Slow reveal animations for the cards (peeking).
    - **Chip Movement**: Parabolic arcs when betting or collecting winnings.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - Headings: **Cinzel** (Classic, Roman-inspired).
    - Body/Numbers: **Lato** or **Roboto Mono** for clear readability of scores and money.

  <design_movement>Midnight High-Roller (Modern Dark)</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Focus**: Dark background to minimize eye strain and highlight the cards.
    2. **Speed**: Snappy animations and minimal distractions for fast-paced simulation.
    3. **Data-Driven**: Emphasize the roadmaps (Big Road, Bead Plate) with crisp, high-contrast graphics.
    4. **Sleekness**: Flat design with subtle gradients, avoiding heavy skeuomorphism.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Obsidian Black (#121212) background.
    Neon Blue (#00F0FF) for Player.
    Hot Pink/Red (#FF0055) for Banker.
    Bright White (#FFFFFF) for text.
    High contrast is key. It feels like a modern online crypto-casino or a high-tech VIP lounge.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Dashboard HUD**:
    - Center: Minimalist card placement area.
    - Bottom Center: Betting controls (floating pill-shaped buttons).
    - Left/Right: Vertical or collapsible panels for history and statistics.
    - Mobile-First: All controls within thumb reach.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    - **Glow Effects**: Winning cards or bets emit a soft neon glow.
    - **Glassmorphism**: Semi-transparent panels for history and settings.
    - **Vector Chips**: Flat, iconic chip designs rather than realistic ones.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Fluid & Instant**: Interactions are immediate. Taps trigger ripples. No lag, just pure speed.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    - **Snap & Flash**: Cards snap into place. Wins trigger a quick flash of light.
    - **Digital Counters**: Numbers scroll rapidly to update (odometer effect).
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - Headings: **Montserrat** (Geometric, modern).
    - Body/Data: **Inter** or **JetBrains Mono** for tabular data.
